# House-Price-Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting house prices using regression algorithms. The project leverages various datasets to train models that analyze features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant factors influencing real estate prices.

Features
    Data Preprocessing: Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and normalize features.
    Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualization and analysis of key trends and patterns in the housing market.
    Regression Algorithms: Implementation of multiple regression techniques, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
    Model Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² scores.

Usage
    Run the Jupyter notebook:
    jupyter notebook
